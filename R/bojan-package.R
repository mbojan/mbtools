#' Michal Bojanowski's collection of function hopefully useful also to others
#' 
#' This package contains some functions, datasets and tools that I created and
#' collected ``along the way''. Among other things the package contains:
#' \itemize{ \item Functions for data analysis, especially for social networks,
#' \item Some illustrative datasets, \item Plotting functions, \item Other
#' statistical data-management and utility funcitions which proved useful at
#' some point and may be useful in the future. }
#' 
#' This package is, and probably will be, and ever-growing collection of
#' functions and data. Some of the routines are to be considered
#' \emph{experimental}. The list of improvements is only a little bit shorter
#' than the list of new features I want to add. Also, the documentation is very
#' scarce in various places. Type \code{help(package="bojan")} for the list of
#' available functions.
#' 
#' If you find this package useful in your work please cite it. Type
#' \code{citation(package="bojan")} for the information how to do that.
#' 
#' Enjoy!
